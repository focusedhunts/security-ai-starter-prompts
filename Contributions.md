# Contributing to Security AI Starter Prompts

We appreciate your interest in improving security professionals' use of AI tools. This repository provides starter prompts as examples and foundations, not as a comprehensive library requiring constant expansion.

---

## Contribution Philosophy

This repository demonstrates prompt engineering principles through practical examples. We intentionally keep it focused rather than trying to cover every possible security task. The goal is teaching the approach, not providing exhaustive templates.

We value:
- **Quality examples** that demonstrate the four principles effectively
- **Honest limitations** about what works and what doesn't  
- **Community learning** through shared experiences
- **Decentralized knowledge** through individual repositories and discussions

## How to Contribute

### Option 1: Fork and Build Your Own Repository (Recommended)

The most valuable contribution is building your own prompt library and sharing it:

**1. Fork this repository** as a starting point

**2. Customize for your context:**
- Adapt prompts to your specific security environment
- Add organization-specific frameworks and requirements
- Develop prompts for your unique operational challenges
- Build verification checklists matching your risk tolerance

**3. Share your repository:**
- Make it public (with sanitized examples only)
- Link to it in our Discussions
- Help others learn from your approach
- Build a community resource specific to your domain

**Why this approach works better:**
- Your prompts reflect real operational experience
- You control what's shared and how it's organized
- Others with similar contexts find more relevant examples
- The community benefits from diverse perspectives

### Option 2: Share Through Discussions

Use GitHub Discussions to contribute without pull requests:

**Share experiences:**
- What prompts worked well for your tasks
- What customizations improved effectiveness
- What verification caught before it became a problem
- What limitations you discovered

**Ask questions:**
- How to adapt prompts for your specific context
- What verification is appropriate for certain tasks
- When AI assistance helps versus hinders
- How others handle similar challenges

**Suggest improvements:**
- Better ways to structure certain prompts
- Missing context dimensions to consider
- Additional verification checkpoints
- Clearer customization guidance

**Link to your work:**
- Share your forked repository
- Point to specific prompts you've developed
- Explain what makes your approach effective
- Help others find resources for their context

## Final Thoughts

The goal isn't building the world's largest prompt repository. It's helping security professionals use AI effectively through clear principles, practical examples, and shared learning.

Your forked repository with context-specific prompts probably helps your peers more than another generic prompt in this collection. Your discussion sharing what worked (or didn't) in your environment probably teaches more than another markdown file.

Contribute in whatever way adds the most value. Build your own library. Share your experiences. Help others learn. The community benefits from all of it.

Thank you for being part of improving security practice in an AI-enabled world.
