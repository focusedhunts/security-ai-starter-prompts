### 3.2 Opening Script & Remarks

**Opening (5-10 minutes)**

[Use this script or customize to your style - the key is to set tone, outline process, and explain what's happening]

---

"Good [morning/afternoon]. Thank you all for being here. I'm [Name], and I'll be facilitating today's tabletop exercise. With me is [Co-facilitator names and roles].

**What We're Doing Today:**
We're running a realistic incident response scenario designed to test our [incident detection / decision-making / cross-functional communication / other]. This isn't a test where there are right or wrong answers—this is a simulation to learn how we work together under pressure.

**The Scenario:**
This morning, we discovered what looks like a ransomware attack affecting multiple systems. It began approximately 2 hours ago. We're going to walk through how we discover, assess, contain, and recover from this incident. I'll be providing information as you would discover it in a real incident—via alerts, help desk calls, reports from IT, etc.

**Your Role:**
Respond to this incident as you would in reality. Use your actual decision-making authorities. If you would escalate to the executive team in real life, do it here. If you would call your insurance company, do it here. This is a chance to test your processes without actual business impact.

**How This Works:**
- I'll present injects (new information) throughout the exercise
- You'll respond and discuss with your colleagues
- I'll occasionally ask questions to probe your thinking
- We'll make some significant decisions together
- At the end, we'll debrief and discuss what we learned

**Timing & Logistics:**
- We have [X hours] for the exercise
- We'll take a [time] break at [time]
- Bathrooms are [location]
- Please keep yourself hydrated—this is cognitively intense
- Questions about logistics? [Pause for questions]

**Ground Rules:**
1. **Speak Up:** Ask questions, challenge assumptions, play devil's advocate. Learning happens in dialogue.
2. **Role Play:** Treat this as a real incident. Use your real titles, real authorities, real processes.
3. **Confidentiality:** What we discuss here stays here. No blame outside this room.
4. **No Penalties:** There's no right answer here. What matters is how you think through problems.
5. **Reality Check:** We're simulating, but based on real incidents. This stuff actually happens.

**What We're Assessing:**
Today we're primarily observing how you:
- Identify and scope the incident
- Make key decisions under uncertainty
- Communicate across departments
- Balance technical, business, and regulatory factors
- Adapt when new information arrives

We'll discuss all of this in the debrief.

**Ready?**
The scenario begins right now. The time is [starting time]. We're here at [location/company], and something has just happened...

---

[Transition to Scenario Briefing]

"Here's the situation: About 2 hours ago, our help desk started getting calls about file access errors. At first, they thought it was a server issue. But then IT Ops checked server logs and found something concerning—evidence of encryption in progress across multiple systems, starting around [start time]...

[Read the Initial Briefing provided below, or share it in writing]

---

### 3.3 Scenario Briefing (For Participants)

[SHARE THIS WITH PARTICIPANTS - verbally or in written form at start of exercise]

**Time: [Start Time], [Date]**

"At approximately [T-2 hours], employees began reporting they couldn't access files on network drives. Help desk thought it was a server connectivity issue and was rebooting systems. But when IT Ops investigated, they found something more serious:

- Multiple servers showing signs of file encryption
- Process logs showing suspicious executable running with admin privileges
- Help desk queue exploding with 'file access denied' tickets
- A file named 'DECRYPT_ME.txt' appearing in common share folders

The message in the ransom note reads:

[Include realistic ransom note that explains what happened, demands, timeline, and threat]

IT Ops has taken the following initial actions:
- Isolated affected servers from the network
- Disabled internet connectivity to prevent further data exfiltration
- Contacted management to escalate

**What you know right now:**
- Estimated 40-60% of file servers are affected
- Email system still working
- Critical systems [specific systems] appear unaffected so far
- Recovery from backup attempted on 2 servers—restores taking longer than expected
- Backups for main file servers are in a separate storage location—status unknown

**What you DON'T know:**
- How long the attacker has been in the network
- Whether the attacker is still present
- Whether data was exfiltrated
- How much of the backup is intact/usable
- Whether this will spread further

**Key People Available:**
- [IT Director] - Can authorize emergency actions and communicate with executives
- [Security Lead] - Can lead investigation and manage incident response
- [Legal Counsel] - Available for regulatory guidance
- [Communications] - Available for internal/external communications

**Immediate Question for You:**
What's your first action? What do you want to know? What do you need to do in the next 30 minutes?"

---

### 3.4 Detailed Inject Script & Delivery

**Inject 1: [Inject Name]**

**Timing:** T+[X] minutes
**Delivery Method:** [Chat / Facilitator verbal / Email / Log display]
**Sent By:** [Who is delivering this info - IT Operations, EDR system, Help desk manager, etc.]

**Exact Inject Content:**
[Word-for-word what participants will see or hear]

Example:
"Alert from EDR system at [time]: Suspicious process 'certutil.exe' with parameter 'urlcache' detected on [system name]. Process running under [admin account]. Child process 'cmd.exe' with parameters indicating file search operations. This pattern is consistent with credential theft or lateral movement."

**Why This Inject Matters:**
[What should participants understand from this info?]
- This shows attacker was performing reconnaissance 1-2 days ago
- Indicates attacker had admin access (how did they get it?)
- Shows attacker was methodical (not a quick hit-and-run attack)

**Expected Participant Response:**
[What should they do with this information?]
- Ask: "Which account was compromised?"
- Follow-up: "Has that account been disabled?"
- Concern: "If attacker had admin creds, where else have they been?"

**If They Don't Respond Appropriately:**
[What if they ignore this or don't follow up?]
Facilitator Coaching: "This credential seems pretty important. The attacker was using it 2 days ago for reconnaissance. What concerns does that raise for you? Where else might they have used it?"

**Facilitator Notes:**
- [Key points to emphasize]
- [If they ask X, respond with Y]
- [Watch for: Are they collecting evidence for forensics?]
- [Timing flexibility: Traditional = let them discuss, Gamified = move to next inject at T+5 regardless]

**Inject 2: [Inject Name]**

*[Same structure for each inject]*

---

### 3.5 Decision Point Facilitation

**Decision Point 1: [Decision Name]**

**Setup:**
[As this decision point arrives in the scenario, facilitator says:]

"We're now at [time in scenario]. We've been investigating for [duration]. Here's the situation: Our recovery from backup is taking longer than expected—probably 2-3 days to restore everything. But the business is losing money every hour we're down.

Meanwhile, we've found evidence that suggests the attacker is demanding a ransom. The question is: Do we pay it?"

**Allowing Time for Discussion:**

**For Traditional Style (20-30 minutes):**
- Present all options clearly upfront: "Your team is discussing three approaches..."
- Let them talk through each option deeply
- Ask: "What are the risks of approach A? The benefits?"
- Wait for them to reach their own decision (don't rush)
- Only jump in to prevent major misunderstandings

**For Blended Style (15 minutes total = 10 min discussion + 5 min decision):**
- Present situation, let them discuss (10 min)
- Announce: "You have 5 minutes to decide"
- Track who's speaking, ensure decision authority is clear
- Call decision at 5 min mark

**For Gamified Style (5 minutes total):**
- Announce: "You have 5 minutes to make this decision. Go."
- Let them figure out options through conversation (no scripted options)
- At 4:00 remaining, say: "Decision time. What are you doing?"
- Record decision, announce consequences immediately

**Probing Questions (If Confusion):**
- "Help me understand the logic here. Why would you [their proposed action]?"
- "What happens if [consequence]? Is that acceptable?"
- "Who has the authority to make this decision? Is that person in the room?"
- "What does our legal counsel say about [option]?"

**Expected Struggles:**
- [Common struggle 1: How to coach]
- [Common struggle 2: How to coach]

**Consequences of Their Choice:**

*If they chose Option A (Aggressive Isolation):*
- "Okay, you're immediately disconnecting all remaining infected systems..."
- [Next inject delivered showing impact]

*If they chose Option B (Ransom Payment):*
- [Inject about payment process, challenges, recovery from backup still needed, attacker reliability issues]

*If they chose Option C (Hybrid):*
- [Inject about both approaches simultaneously, complications]

---

### 3.6 Complication Management

**Complication 1: [Complication Name]**

**When to Introduce:** [Trigger point in scenario]

**What to Say (Facilitator Delivery):**
"I just got a call from [person]. They're saying [complication detail]. This changes things..."

**How Participants Likely React:**
- [Reaction 1]
- [Reaction 2]
- [Coaching needed: If they panic, say...]

**Impact on Previous Decisions:**
If they chose [Option A], this complication means [new consequence]
If they chose [Option B], this complication means [new consequence]

**Next Steps:**
Move scenario forward with new information

---

### 3.7 Timing Management & Adaptive Approach

**Master Timeline:**

| Clock Time | Scenario Time | What's Happening | Facilitator Action | Flexibility |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
| 10:00 AM | T+0 | Exercise starts, initial briefing | Deliver opening remarks | [Fixed: 5 min] |
| 10:05 AM | T+0 | Scenario briefing | Participants understand situation | [Flexible: adjust if needed] |
| 10:15 AM | T+15 | Inject 1-A | Deliver via [method] | [Flexible for Traditional] |
| 10:30 AM | T+30 | Inject 1-B | Deliver | [Flexible] |
| 10:45 AM | T+45 | Inject 2-A | Deliver | [Flexible] |
| 11:00 AM | T+60 | Decision Point 1 | Facilitate discussion & decision | [Fixed for Gamified: 5 min decision time] |
| 11:05 AM | T+65 | Consequence of decision | Move scenario forward | [Flexible] |

**Flexibility Rules by Style:**

**Traditional Exercise:**
- If discussion is rich and learning, let it continue beyond planned time
- Move to next inject only when group is ready
- Total time is flexible (may run long if engagement is high)

**Blended Exercise:**
- Stick to timing roughly, but allow ±5 minutes per inject for good discussion
- If behind, compress next discussion slightly
- Target end time is important (participants have other commitments)

**Gamified Exercise:**
- Timing is strict (this is the pressure)
- Decision windows are exactly as announced
- Move to next inject on schedule regardless of readiness
- This creates the high-intensity experience

**What to Do If Behind Schedule:**

*If you're 20 minutes behind:*
- [Traditional]: No problem—just let it end when it ends
- [Blended]: Compress next discussions by 2-3 minutes each
- [Gamified]: Either extend total exercise time, or skip a lower-priority inject

*If you're 20 minutes ahead:*
- [Traditional]: Add optional decision point or complication discussion
- [Blended]: Spend more time on most recent decision point discussion
- [Gamified]: Add additional complication or decision point

### 3.8 Observation Guidance for Facilitators

**Watch These Dynamics:**

**Communication Patterns:**
- Who talks? Who's silent?
- Do senior people dominate, or do junior people speak up?
- Are people listening to each other or talking past each other?
- Does it feel collaborative or contentious?

**Decision-Making Process:**
- Do they gather information before deciding, or decide quickly?
- Is decision authority clear (does everyone know who gets to decide)?
- Are they considering both technical and business factors?
- Are they confident or uncertain?

**Cross-Functional Coordination:**
- Does IT talk to Security? To Legal? To Business?
- Are there silos (e.g., IT making decisions without consulting Business)?
- Do they loop in appropriate decision-makers?
- Are disagreements handled productively or destructively?

**Stress Responses:**
- Who gets stressed? Who stays calm?
- Do people adapt when new information arrives?
- Are they defensive or curious when gaps are identified?
- Do they help each other or blame?

**Technical Understanding:**
- Do technical staff explain clearly to non-technical people?
- Do non-technical people ask clarifying questions?
- Are there technical disagreements that aren't resolved?
- Is jargon a barrier?

**Decision Quality:**
- Are they considering consequences of their choices?
- Are they acknowledging uncertainty and risk?
- Are they considering regulatory/compliance factors?
- Are they balancing speed with deliberation appropriately?

### 3.9 Observer Evaluation Form

**Observation Note Template (For Co-Facilitators/Observers):**

```
OBSERVATION: [Timestamp] [What you observed]

SIGNIFICANCE: [Why does this matter? What does it reveal about IR capability?]

PATTERN: [Is this a pattern or one-time event? What does the pattern suggest?]

COACHING OPPORTUNITY: [Did the facilitator coach? Was coaching helpful?]
```

**Example Entries:**

```
OBSERVATION: 10:47 AM - When IT Director proposed aggressive isolation, CEO immediately said "no, we need access to [system] for business operations" without asking about alternatives.

SIGNIFICANCE: Shows decision authority is unclear - CEO may not understand technical options, IT Director may not understand business impact. Neither was trying to find compromise.

PATTERN: Throughout exercise, technical and business teams were talking past each other - not collaborating.

COACHING OPPORTUNITY: Facilitator asked "What if we isolated just the [specific system] instead?" This prompted real discussion about tradeoffs for first time.
```

---

### 3.10 Debrief Facilitation (45-60 minutes)

**Debrief Structure & Script**

**Phase 1: Immediate Reactions (5-10 minutes)**

Facilitator says:
"Let's debrief. First, just reaction: What was that experience like? Take a moment and share what stands out to you."

[Listen without judging - just collect reactions]

Key observations:
- Were they energized or drained?
- Did they feel the pressure? The realism?
- Any comments about surprises or things they missed?

**Phase 2: Scenario Walkthrough (15-20 minutes)**

Facilitator says:
"Let's walk through what happened. I'm going to take you through the timeline, and at certain points I'll ask you to reflect on your thinking."

**At Each Decision Point:**

"At [time] in the scenario, we reached a decision point about [topic]. Let's talk about that.

- What was your team thinking at that moment?
- Walk me through how you arrived at your decision.
- What information did you have? What were you uncertain about?
- Looking back, would you make the same decision? Why or why not?
- What was the consequence of your choice?"

[Document their thinking - this is evaluation data]

**At Each Complication:**

"Then we introduced [complication]. How did that affect your thinking?
- Did it surprise you?
- How did your plans change?
- In a real incident, what would this complication have meant for you?"

**Phase 3: Capabilities Assessment (15-20 minutes)**

Facilitator says:
"Let's connect this back to what we were trying to learn. Our primary objectives were [list objectives].

Let's assess how we did:"

**For Each Objective:**

"Objective 1 was: [Objective]. How did we do on that?

[Specific evaluation based on what you observed]
- You successfully [capability observed]
- Where we struggled was [gap observed]
- Specifically, when [situation], you [behavior], which [impact]"

**Specific Questions for Capabilities:**

*On Detection/Response:*
"When you first discovered the ransomware, how long did it take to understand scope? Did you ask the right questions? What would you do differently?"

*On Decision-Making:*
"Let's talk about the decision to [their choice]. That's a big decision with lots of factors. Walk me through your reasoning:
- What would've happened if you'd chosen differently?
- Do you feel confident in that decision?
- What surprised you about the decision?"

*On Communication:*
"I observed that [specific communication pattern]. In a real incident, how would that have played out? What would've been better?"

*On Cross-Functional Coordination:*
"Did IT, Security, Legal, and Business all have input on decisions? Did some groups feel like they weren't heard? How could you improve that?"

**Phase 4: Organizational Insights (10-15 minutes)**

Facilitator says:
"Beyond the technical details, what does this exercise tell us about how we work together as an organization?"

**Key Questions:**

1. "What gaps did we identify in our IR processes or capabilities?"
2. "What did we do really well that we should keep doing?"
3. "What surprised us about how we work together?"
4. "What changes will we make based on this exercise?"
5. "Who owns making those changes? What's the timeline?"

[Document everything - this becomes the follow-up action plan]

**Phase 5: Closing Remarks (5 minutes)**

"Thank you all. This was excellent. The insights we've gathered here will help us strengthen our IR capabilities. Here's what happens next:

- [Facilitator name] will compile a summary of key findings within [X days]
- We'll schedule a follow-up meeting with [leadership] to discuss improvements
- We'll assign owners to specific action items
- We'll do another TTX in [timeframe] to validate improvements

Any final questions?"

## Document 4: Participant Briefing Materials

[These are the non-spoiler materials participants receive]

### Participant Pre-Exercise Brief

**What is a Tabletop Exercise?**
A tabletop exercise (TTX) is a realistic discussion-based simulation of an incident. Unlike physical drills, there's no equipment to set up or systems to manipulate. Instead, information arrives in a scenario, and your team responds as you would in reality.

**What We're Doing Today:**
We're simulating a significant incident response scenario. As new information arrives throughout the exercise, your team will make decisions about containment, recovery, and communication. At the end, we'll debrief on how we did.

**What You Should Know:**
- **This is a learning opportunity.** There are no right or wrong answers. What matters is how you think through problems and work together.
- **Use your real titles and authorities.** If you would escalate to the CEO in a real incident, do it here.
- **Speak up.** Ask questions, challenge assumptions, volunteer ideas. Good learning happens in dialogue.
- **Be realistic.** Don't do anything you wouldn't do in a real incident (like "let's just contact the military"). Stay in reality.

**Expected Duration:** [X hours]

**Bring:** Pen and paper to take notes

### Reference Materials for Participants

**Organizational Structure:**
[Organization chart showing decision authorities]

**Key System Names:**
[List of critical systems and their purposes]

**Important Contacts:**
[List of key people and their roles/contact info]

**Decision Authorities Matrix:**
[Who has authority to make which types of decisions?]

**Key Policies/Procedures:**
[IR Plan, Backup procedures, Communication protocols, etc.]

## Document 5: Observer/Evaluator Forms

### Observer Briefing

**Your Role as Observer:**
As an observer, you're watching how the team responds to the scenario. You're NOT participating—just watching and taking notes. Your role is to provide objective feedback on what you see.

**What to Watch For:**
- Communication patterns: How does information flow? Who talks? Who listens?
- Decision-making: How are major decisions made? Is authority clear?
- Cross-functional coordination: Does IT talk to Security? To Business? To Legal?
- Stress responses: How do people handle uncertainty and pressure?
- Technical accuracy: Are technical decisions sound? Does everyone understand?

**What NOT to Do:**
- Don't jump in and help (let them work through problems)
- Don't answer their questions (they need to figure it out)
- Don't judge them (just observe objectively)
- Don't have side conversations (stay focused on observation)

**Form to Use:**
