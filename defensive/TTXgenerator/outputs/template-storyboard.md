- [ ] Have timing clock visible and ready

### Opening Remarks (Suggested Script - Customize as Needed)

"Good [morning/afternoon]. Thank you for being here. We're running a tabletop exercise today focusing on [exercise objectives]. This is a simulation—everything we discuss today stays here, and there are no 'right answers.' What matters is how you think through problems and work together.

Here's how this works:
- I'll present a scenario that unfolds in real-time
- Information arrives as injects—via chat, verbally, or emails
- You'll respond as you would in a real incident
- We'll make some tough decisions together
- At the end, we'll debrief and discuss what we learned

[Logistics: duration, breaks, questions, bathroom, etc.]

Ground rules: This is a learning environment. Speak up, ask questions, challenge assumptions. No blame—we're all here to improve.

Ready? Let's get started. The scenario begins right now..."

### Facilitator's Incident Timeline (How to Run the Exercise)

| Time | What Facilitator Does | Inject # | What to Watch For | Timing Flexibility |
|------|--------------------|----|---------|---|
| T+0 | Deliver opening remarks, share initial briefing | 1-A | Are they understanding the situation? Are they taking initial actions? | [Flexible for Traditional / Tight for Gamified] |
| T+[X] | Deliver Inject 1-B via [delivery method] | 1-B | Are they asking right follow-up questions? | [Flexible if discussion is rich] |
| T+[Y] | Ask: "What's your response?" / Allow [Z] min for discussion | - | Who's talking? Who's quiet? Are decisions being made? | [Traditional: flexible / Gamified: strict] |
| T+[Time] | Deliver Decision Point Scenario setup | DP-1 | Do they understand what decision needs to be made? | [Allow time for discussion based on style] |
| T+[Time] | Deliver Complication 1 | COMPL-1 | Watch for panic, frustration, or adaptation. Coach as needed. | [Surprise for Gamified / Announced for Traditional] |
| T+[End] | Call time, transition to debrief | - | How are they feeling? Are they engaged? | [Energetic handoff to debrief] |

### Observation Guidance

**What to Watch For:**
- Communication patterns: Who talks? Who listens? Any conflicts?
- Decision-making process: Do they gather information first or decide quickly?
- Role clarity: Is decision authority clear? Do decisions match organizational structure?
- Escalation timing: When do they loop in executives? Appropriate or delayed?
- Technical depth: Do technical staff explain clearly? Do non-technical staff understand?
- Stress responses: Who stays calm? Who gets frustrated? How do they recover?

**Observer Checklist:**

| Observation Area | Details | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Detection Phase** | [Did they ask right questions?] | |
| **Investigation Phase** | [Did they pursue evidence?] | |
| **Containment Decision** | [Was decision made clearly?] | |
| **Recovery Planning** | [Did they consider impact on business?] | |
| **Communication** | [Did they keep stakeholders informed?] | |

### Common Participant Pitfalls & Coaching

**Pitfall 1: [Common mistake - e.g., "Only focusing on IT, forgetting business impact"]**
- **What it looks like:** [How you'll recognize if they're making this mistake]
- **Why it happens:** [Root cause of this thinking]
- **Coaching approach:** Ask: "[Socratic question that guides them to better thinking]"
- **If they ignore coaching:** Move to next scenario element, revisit in debrief

**Pitfall 2: [Common mistake]**
*[Same structure]*

**Pitfall 3: [Common mistake]**
*[Same structure]*

### Decision Facilitation Guide

**For Each Decision Point:**
1. Ensure participants understand the decision that needs to be made
2. Allow them to gather information / ask clarifying questions
3. Present options (either let them discover, or state explicitly - depends on style)
4. Allow discussion time (duration varies: Traditional 20-30 min, Blended 10-15 min, Gamified 5 min)
5. Ask: "What's your decision?" and confirm with relevant parties
6. Brief them on consequences of their choice (move scenario forward)
7. Note decision for debrief (this is evaluation data)
