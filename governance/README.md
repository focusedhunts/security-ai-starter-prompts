# GRC Operations: Advanced Starter Prompts

> **Purpose:** These prompts demonstrate advanced prompt engineering for Governance, Risk, and Compliance work, applying the four principles (Context, Specificity, Structure, Iteration) with professional-grade techniques including personas, chain-of-thought reasoning, and constraint-based prompting.

> **⚠️ Critical Security Notice:** Enterprise vs Consumer tool guidance is provided for each prompt. Sanitize sensitive information BEFORE prompting - never paste real configurations then ask AI to sanitize them.

## How to Use These Prompts

### 🎯 These Are Foundations, Not Final Products
Each prompt is designed to be **copied, customized, and expanded** with your specific:
- Framework versions and control IDs
- Organizational context and constraints  
- Risk methodology and rating criteria
- Audience technical literacy levels
- Documentation standards and formats

### 🔧 Customization Approach
1. **Read the entire prompt** to understand its structure
2. **Replace [BRACKETED_PLACEHOLDERS]** with your specifics
3. **Adjust context layers** based on your environment
4. **Test with low-stakes content** first to calibrate output quality
5. **Iterate based on results** - refine context, specificity, or structure as needed

### 🏢 Enterprise vs 🌐 Consumer Tool Guidance
Each prompt includes:
- **🏢 Enterprise Tool Additions:** What to include when using tools with data processing agreements
- **🌐 Consumer Tool Restrictions:** What to remove/abstract when using public AI services

### ✅ Verification Mindset
Every output requires verification before organizational use:
- Factual accuracy against actual implementation
- Evidence availability to support claims
- Framework/regulatory compliance
- Appropriate stakeholder approval

## Final Notes on These Prompts

### Customization Is Required
These prompts are intentionally incomplete - they're frameworks requiring your:
- Specific framework versions and control IDs
- Organizational context and constraints
- Risk methodology and rating scales
- Actual implementation details (appropriately sanitized)
- Stakeholder roles and approval processes

### Verification Is Non-Negotiable
Every output from these prompts requires verification:
- Factual accuracy against actual implementation
- Consistency with documented procedures
- Evidence availability to support claims
- Appropriate stakeholder review and approval

### Enterprise vs Consumer Tool Guidance
The 🏢 and 🌐 annotations throughout show:
- What information is appropriate for enterprise tools with data processing agreements
- What must be abstracted/removed for consumer AI services
- How to maintain utility while protecting sensitive information

### Advanced Techniques Demonstrated
These prompts incorporate:
- **Personas**: "You are a [role] with [specific objective]"
- **Chain-of-thought**: "Think through this systematically..." with step-by-step reasoning
- **Structured output**: Specific formats, tables, and organization schemas
- **Constraint-based**: "You must only use information provided..." to prevent hallucination
- **Few-shot learning**: Examples embedded to guide output quality
- **Negative prompting**: Explicit "Do NOT..." instructions

### Building Your Prompt Library
As you use these prompts:
1. Document what works and what needs refinement
2. Capture your organizational specifics as reusable context
3. Track which advanced techniques produce best results for your needs
4. Version control your customized prompts as frameworks evolve
5. Share effective prompts with your team for consistency

### Remember the Four Principles
Every prompt here applies:
- **Context**: Role, environment, constraints explicitly defined
- **Specificity**: Exact requirements, frameworks, output formats
- **Structure**: Phased approaches, systematic thinking, organized outputs
- **Iteration**: Refinement guidance, verification checkpoints, continuous improvement
