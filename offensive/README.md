# Red Team Operations: Advanced Starter Prompts

> **Purpose:** These prompts demonstrate advanced prompt engineering for Red Team offensive security operations, applying the four principles (Context, Specificity, Structure, Iteration) with professional-grade techniques including personas, chain-of-thought reasoning, and operational security frameworks.

> **⚠️ Critical Legal and Ethical Notice:** Red Team work requires proper authorization. Every prompt assumes signed contracts, explicit scope agreements, and legal protections. Enterprise vs Consumer tool guidance is provided for each prompt. Sanitize ALL sensitive information (target details, discovered vulnerabilities, credentials, operational methods) BEFORE prompting. Never paste actual engagement data then ask AI to sanitize it.

## How to Use These Prompts

### 🎯 These Are Foundations, Not Final Products
Each prompt is designed to be **copied, customized, and expanded** with your specific:
- Engagement scope and rules of engagement
- Target environment characteristics (sanitized appropriately)
- Authorized techniques and prohibited actions
- Operational security requirements and constraints
- Reporting standards and audience technical levels

### 🔧 Customization Approach
1. **Read the entire prompt** to understand its operational context
2. **Replace [BRACKETED_PLACEHOLDERS]** with your engagement specifics
3. **Adjust context layers** based on authorization boundaries
4. **Test with historical/lab data** first to calibrate output quality
5. **Iterate based on operational results** - refine attack paths, exploitation approaches

### 🏢 Enterprise vs 🌐 Consumer Tool Guidance
Each prompt includes:
- **🏢 Enterprise Tool Additions:** What to include when using tools with data processing agreements
- **🌐 Consumer Tool Restrictions:** What to remove/abstract when using public AI services

### ✅ Verification Mindset for Red Team Work
Red Team outputs require rigorous verification due to operational and legal impact:
- Exploitation code must be tested in isolated environments before operational use
- Reconnaissance findings must be validated against authoritative sources
- Attack paths must be verified for scope compliance
- Social engineering content must be reviewed for ethical appropriateness

**Authorization Consideration:** Red Team work operates under strict legal constraints. Build scope verification into your workflow rather than treating it as optional post-generation step.

## Final Notes on These Prompts

### Purpose and Customization
These Red Team prompts demonstrate advanced prompt engineering applied to offensive security operations. Unlike simple query templates, they incorporate:
- **Authorization-aware context** that maintains legal and ethical boundaries
- **Operational constraints** reflecting real red team challenges (scope compliance, operational security, time-limited engagements)
- **Verification frameworks** appropriate to offensive work where errors have legal consequences
- **Collaboration patterns** showing how AI can support team-based offensive operations

### Customization is Mandatory
Every prompt requires adaptation to your engagement:
- **Your authorization scope** determines what systems and techniques are permitted
- **Your target environment** defines what reconnaissance reveals and what's exploitable
- **Your rules of engagement** shape operational security and impact boundaries
- **Your client expectations** determine reporting depth and technical detail

Generic application of these prompts will produce sub-optimal results. The value comes from thoughtful customization within authorization boundaries.

### Enterprise vs Consumer Tool Guidance
Throughout these prompts, 🏢 and 🌐 annotations show:
- **What to include** when using enterprise tools with data processing agreements (sanitized target patterns, specific techniques, operational planning)
- **What to abstract** when using consumer AI services (generic descriptions, abstract patterns, theoretical approaches)

This isn't about hiding information from AI, but about matching operational sensitivity to tool trust level.

### Verification is Non-Negotiable
Red Team work demands verification because:
- **Exploitation code** that crashes systems violates engagement terms
- **Reconnaissance data** that's wrong wastes time and misdirects operations
- **Attack paths** that exceed scope create legal liability
- **Social engineering** that crosses ethical lines damages professional reputation

Every prompt includes verification checkpoints. Don't skip them.

### Integration with Red Team Workflows
These prompts assume integration into existing workflows:
- **Reconnaissance** feeds into attack planning, which drives exploitation operations
- **Initial access** produces footholds that enable lateral movement and privilege escalation
- **Exploitation findings** generate evidence for reporting and remediation recommendations
- **Documentation** happens continuously, not just at engagement end
- **Team handoffs** between reconnaissance, exploitation, and reporting specialists

The prompts are designed to support team-based offensive operations, not replace them.

### Advanced Techniques Demonstrated
These prompts incorporate professional prompt engineering practices:
- **Personas** ("You are a red team operator planning initial access...")
- **Chain-of-thought reasoning** ("Think through this attack path systematically...")
- **Structured output** (Attack trees, technique mappings, standardized report formats)
- **Constraint-based prompting** ("You must only suggest techniques within authorized scope...")
- **Iterative refinement** (Multi-phase approaches with validation checkpoints)
- **Context layering** (Authorization → Target Environment → Operational Constraints → Task)

Study how these techniques are applied to improve your own prompting.

### Building Your Prompt Library
As you use and refine these prompts:
1. **Document what works** - When a prompt produces excellent results, save your customized version
2. **Capture engagement patterns** - Your reconnaissance methods, your exploitation approaches, your reporting templates
3. **Version control your prompts** - Track improvements over time
4. **Share with your team** - Consistent prompts produce comparable outputs
5. **Review and refine** - After-action reviews to ensure prompts match operational reality

### Limits of AI in Red Team Operations
These prompts enable AI to **accelerate** Red Team work, not replace it:
- AI can help **synthesize** reconnaissance faster, but you verify findings
- AI can **draft** payloads, but you test them comprehensively before operational use
- AI can **suggest** attack paths, but you make scope compliance decisions
- AI can **document** findings, but you ensure factual accuracy before client delivery

The prompts assume human judgment remains in the loop. Automation without validation creates risk.

### Continuous Improvement
Red Team offensive operations evolve:
- **Defense landscape changes** - New defensive techniques require operational adaptation
- **Your tradecraft evolves** - New tools and techniques enable different approaches
- **AI capabilities improve** - Better models enable more sophisticated assistance
- **Your understanding deepens** - Experience reveals better prompting approaches

Treat these prompts as starting points that improve through systematic use and refinement.

### Feedback and Iteration
These prompts benefit from your real-world testing:
- **What worked well?** - Techniques worth replicating
- **What needed refinement?** - Prompts requiring more context or structure
- **What was missing?** - Scenarios these prompts don't address
- **What verification caught?** - Errors that would have caused operational problems

Learn from each use to improve the next.

### The Human Element
Remember that effective Red Team operations require:
- **Technical skill** - Understanding how systems work and how to exploit them
- **Tool proficiency** - Knowing your reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation frameworks
- **Operational thinking** - Planning attack paths, maintaining operational security, adapting to defenses
- **Communication** - Explaining technical findings to stakeholders at appropriate detail levels
- **Ethical judgment** - Maintaining professional boundaries even under client pressure

AI augments these capabilities, but cannot replace them. Use these prompts to work smarter, not to avoid developing expertise.

### Legal and Ethical Boundaries
Every prompt in this document assumes:
- **Proper authorization** through signed contracts and explicit scope agreements
- **Legal protections** including liability coverage and legal counsel review
- **Ethical conduct** maintaining professional standards even when technically capable of more
- **Scope compliance** where human judgment determines what's authorized, not AI

Using these prompts outside proper authorization is criminal activity. AI assistance doesn't reduce your responsibility for maintaining legal and ethical boundaries.
